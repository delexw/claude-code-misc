# Phase 6: Execute Per Planning

> **Worktree reminder:** If Phase 2.5 created a worktree, ensure you are in the worktree directory before proceeding (`cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"`).

- Launch a `Task` call with prompt containing all knowledge from `<OPTIMIZED_PROMPT>` and the implementation plan, instructing it to:
  - **Execute Per Planning** — follow the phased order defined in `TICKET_ASSETS_DIR/implementation-plan.md`
  - Complete each phase fully before starting the next
